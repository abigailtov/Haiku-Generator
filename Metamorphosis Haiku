How about if I
sleep a little bit longer
and forget all this

Id get kicked out on
the spot But who knows maybe
that would be the best

And he looked over
at the alarm clock ticking
on the chest of drawers

Im still in bed now
Im quite fresh again now though
Im just getting out

Gregor would sometimes
catch a friendly comment or
at least a comment

His father though was
not in the mood to notice
subtleties like that

Gregor was amazed
at the enormous size of
the soles of his boots

He had been reduced
to the condition of an
ancient invalid

They no longer held
the lively conversations
of earlier times

Gregor hardly slept
at all either night or day
Sometimes he would think

The family was
totally preoccupied
with the violin

The three gentlemen
stepped out of their room and looked
round in amazement
