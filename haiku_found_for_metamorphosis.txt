Kafka Translated
by David Wyllie I One
morning when Gregor

It showed a lady
fitted out with a fur hat
and fur boa who

Gregor then turned to
look out the window at the
dull weather Drops of

Drops of rain could be
heard hitting the pane which made
him feel quite sad How

How about if I
sleep a little bit longer
and forget all this

I sleep a little
bit longer and forget all
this nonsense he thought

However hard he
threw himself onto his right
he always rolled back

Travelling day in
and day out Doing business
like this takes much more

It can all go to
Hell He felt a slight itch up
on his belly pushed

Hell He felt a slight
itch up on his belly pushed
himself slowly up

I go back to the
guest house during the morning
to copy out the

I ought to just try
that with my boss Id get kicked
out on the spot But

Id get kicked out on
the spot But who knows maybe
that would be the best

And he looked over
at the alarm clock ticking
on the chest of drawers

It was half past six
and the hands were quietly
moving forwards it

Had the alarm clock
not rung He could see from the
bed that it had been

True he had not slept
peacefully but probably
all the more deeply

What should he do now
The next train went at seven
if he were to catch

The next train went at
seven if he were to catch
that he would have to

What about if he
reported sick But that would
be extremely strained

Gregor had never
once yet been ill His boss would
certainly come round

And whats more would he
have been entirely wrong
in this case Gregor

There was a cautious
knock at the door near his head
Gregor somebody

Gregor somebody
called it was his mother its
quarter to seven

Gregor had wanted
to give a full answer and
explain everything

Gregor he called whats
wrong And after a short while
he called again with

Gregor Arent you
well Do you need anything
Gregor answered to

Arent you well Do
you need anything Gregor
answered to both sides

Gregor open the
door I beg of you Gregor
however had no

Gregor however
had no thought of opening
the door and instead

He remembered that
he had often felt a slight
pain in bed perhaps

He did not have the
slightest doubt that the change in
his voice was nothing

If he wanted to
bend one of them then that was
the first one that would

This is something that
cant be done in bed Gregor
said to himself so

This he managed quite
easily and despite its
breadth and its weight the

But when he had at
last got his head out of the
bed and into the

And he could not knock
himself out now at any
price better to stay

At times like this he
would direct his eyes to the
window and look out

Ill definitely
have to have got properly
out of bed And by

If he succeeded
in falling out of bed in
this way and kept his

Two strong people he
had his father and the maid
in mind would have been

Should he really call
for help though even apart
from the fact that all

After a while he
had already moved so far
across that it would

The time was now ten
past seven and he would have
to make a final

Were all employees
every one of them louts
was there not one of

And more because these
thoughts had made him upset than
through any proper

He had not held his
head carefully enough though
and hit it as he

Somethings fallen down
in there said the chief clerk in
the room on the left

But as if in gruff
reply to this question the
chief clerks firm footsteps

Gregor to himself
but without daring to raise
his voice loud enough

So please open up
this door Im sure hell be good
enough to forgive

It nearly makes me
cross the way he never goes
out in the evenings

He sits with us in
the kitchen and just reads the
paper or studies

Ill be there in a
moment said Gregor slowly
and thoughtfully but

But on the other
hand I must say that if we
people in commerce

Gregor In the room
on his right there followed a
painful silence in

In the room on his
right there followed a painful
silence in the room

She had probably
only just got up and had
not even begun

Was it because he
had not got up and had not
let the chief clerk in

There was no need to
worry about things like that
yet Gregor was still

Im speaking here on
behalf of your parents and
of your employer

I am astonished
quite astonished I thought I
knew you as a calm

I thought I knew you
as a calm and sensible
person and now you

But now that I see
your incomprehensible
stubbornness I no

I no longer feel
any wish whatsoever
to intercede on

Im still in bed now
Im quite fresh again now though
Im just getting out

Im just getting out
of bed Just a moment Be
patient Its not quite

Be patient Its not
quite as easy as Id thought
Im quite alright now

Its shocking what can
suddenly happen to a
person I was quite

And while Gregor gushed
out these words hardly knowing
what he was saying

Gregor gushed out these
words hardly knowing what he
was saying he made

He really did want
to open the door really
did want to let them

The first few times he
tried to climb up on the smooth
chest of drawers he just

Now he let himself
fall against the back of a
nearby chair and held

Did you understand
a word of all that the chief
clerk asked his parents

Grete Grete she then cried
Mother his sister called from
the other side They

Mother his sister
called from the other side They
communicated

Gregor is ill Quick
get the doctor Did you hear
the way Gregor spoke

Quick get the doctor
Did you hear the way Gregor
spoke just now That was

That was the voice of
an animal said the chief
clerk with a calmness

There was no sound of
the door banging shut again
they must have left it

The first response to
his situation had been
confident and wise

Whatever was said
next would be crucial so in
order to make his

Gregor slowly pushed
his way over to the door
with the chair Once there

Well done Gregor they
should have cried keep at it keep
hold of the lock And

Gregor they should have
cried keep at it keep hold of
the lock And with the

As the key turned round
he turned around the lock with
it only holding

Because he had to
open the door in this way
it was already

Now he also saw
him he was the nearest to
the door his hand pressed

Then she unfolded
her arms took two steps forward
towards Gregor and

Gregor and sank down
onto the floor into her
skirts that spread themselves

Gregor did not go
into the room but leant
against the inside

In this way only
half of his body could be
seen along with his

The washing up from
breakfast lay on the table
there was so much of

Now then said Gregor
well aware that he was the
only one to have

Gregor well aware
that he was the only one
to have kept calm Ill

Will you please just let
me leave You can see he said
to the chief clerk that

You can see he said
to the chief clerk that Im not
stubborn and I like

They think we earn an
enormous wage as well as
having a soft time

But you sir you have
a better overview than
the rest of the staff

Im at least partly
right But the chief clerk had turned
away as soon as

Gregor had started
to speak and with protruding
lips only stared back

He did not keep still
for a moment while Gregor
was speaking but moved

In the hall he stretched
his right hand far out towards
the stairway as if

That was something his
parents did not understand
very well over

Gregor though did think
about the future The chief
clerk had to be held

The chief clerk had to
be held back calmed down convinced
and finally won

But his sister was
not there Gregor would have to
do the job himself

He held back the urge
to move but swayed from side to
side as he crouched there

His mother was not
far away in front of him
and seemed at first quite

Gregor better but
the unthinking way she was
hurrying backwards

He had completely
forgotten the chief clerk for
the moment but could

Gregor though had no
time to spare for his parents
now the chief clerk had

Gregor made a run
for him he wanted to be
sure of reaching him

Gregor had only
been allowed to turn round he
would have been back in

He was pleased when he
finally had his head in
front of the doorway

What he did making
more noise than ever was to
drive Gregor forwards

Gregor forwards all
the harder as if there had
been nothing in the

Gregor as if there
was now more than one father
behind him it was

Gregor pushed himself
into the doorway without
regard for what might

Gregor was it was
dark He pushed himself over
to the door feeling

The whole of his left
side seemed like one painfully
stretched scar and he limped

By the door there was
a dish filled with sweetened milk
with little pieces

Through the crack in the
door Gregor could see that the
gas had been lit in

That was something that
Gregor did not want to think
about too much so

Gregor did not want
to think about too much so
he started to move

Gregor waited in
vain The previous morning
while the doors were locked

It was not until
late at night that the gaslight
in the living room

For some reason the
tall empty room where he was
forced to remain made

Hardly aware of
what he was doing other
than a slight feeling

It pressed down on his
back a little and he was
no longer able

Some of the time he
passed in a light sleep although
he frequently woke

She did not see him
straight away but when she did
notice him under

Gregor had pushed his
head forward right to the edge
of the couch and watched

In order to test
his taste she brought him a whole
selection of things

I used to be then
he thought and was already
sucking greedily

She quickly dropped it
all into a bin closed it
with its wooden lid

This was how Gregor
received his food each day now
once in the morning

Gregor to find out
what they had told the doctor
and the locksmith that

Gregor would sometimes
catch a friendly comment or
at least a comment

And on the very
first day the maid had fallen
to her knees and begged

It was not very
clear how much she knew of what
had happened but she

When his father then
said nothing she would add so
that he would not feel

No and no more would
be said Even before the
first day had come to

Gregor heard how he
opened the complicated
lock and then closed it

Gregor had later
earned so much that he was in
a position to

They had even got
used to it both Gregor and
the family they

Their parents did not
like to hear this innocent
talk but Gregor thought

Gregor thought about
it quite hard and decided
he would let them know

That was the sort of
totally pointless thing that
went through his mind in

From these repeated
explanations Gregor learned
to his pleasure that

Gregor learned to his
pleasure that despite all their
misfortunes there was

It was not a lot
but it had not been touched in
the meantime and some

Besides that they had
not been using up all the
money that Gregor

During the five years
that he had not been working
the first holiday

Would his sister have
to go and earn money She
was still a child of

Gregor had only
been able to speak to his
sister and thank her

Gregor was also
able to see through it all
so much better It

No sooner had she
come in than she would quickly
close the door as a

Gregor twice a day
with this running about and
noise making he would

Gregor went straight to
hide himself under the couch
of course but he had

One day in order
to spare her even this sight
he spent four hours

If she did not think
this sheet was necessary
then all she had to

She left the sheet where
it was Gregor even thought
he glimpsed a look of

Gregor had eaten
how he had behaved this time
and whether perhaps

Later though she had
to be held back by force which
made her call out Let

Gregor he is my
unfortunate son Cant you
understand I have

Gregor would think to
himself that maybe it would
be better if his

Gregor wanted to
avoid being seen at the
window during the

Gregor could hear his
mother express her joy but
once at the door she

The old chest of drawers
was too heavy for a pair
of feeble women

He had come very
close to forgetting and it
had only been the

Grete would probably
be the only one who would
dare enter a room

The chest of drawers was
something that Gregor could do
without if he had

Hardly had the two
women pushed the chest of drawers
groaning out of the

Gregor poked his head
out from under the couch to
see what he could do

His mother was not
used to the sight of Gregor
he might have made her

She stood very still
remained there a moment and
then went back out to

With his head and legs
pulled in against him and his
body pressed to the

They were emptying
his room out taking away
everything that was

So while the women
were leant against the desk
in the other room

They had not allowed
themselves a long rest and came
back quite soon Grete had

Grete had put her arm
around her mother and was
nearly carrying

What shall we take now
then said Grete and looked around
Her eyes met those of

Grete and looked around
Her eyes met those of Gregor
on the wall Perhaps

Her eyes met those of
Gregor on the wall Perhaps
only because her

Gregor on the wall
Perhaps only because her
mother was there she

Come on lets go back
in the living room for a
while Gregor could see

Gregor could see what
Grete had in mind she wanted
to take her mother

Grete had in mind she
wanted to take her mother
somewhere safe and then

Oh God oh God Arms
outstretched she fell onto the
couch as if she had

God Arms outstretched she
fell onto the couch as if
she had given up

Gregor shouted his
sister glowering at him
and shaking her fist

She ran into the
other room to fetch some kind
of smelling salts to

Grete took hold of all
the bottles she could and ran
with them in to her

So now Gregor was
shut out from his mother who
because of him might

Gregor was shut out
from his mother who because
of him might be near

He lay there for a
while numb and immobile all
around him it was

Then there was someone
at the door The maid of course
had locked herself in

The maid of course had
locked herself in her kitchen
so that Grete would have

Grete would have to go
and answer it His father
had arrived home Whats

She answered him with
subdued voice and openly
pressed her face into

Gregor got out Just
as I expected said his
father just as I

Gregor that Grete had
not said enough and that his
father took it to

That meant Gregor would
now have to try to calm his
father as he did

Gregor would now have
to try to calm his father
as he did not have

His father though was
not in the mood to notice
subtleties like that

Ah he shouted as
he came in sounding as if
he were both angry

He really had not
imagined his father the
way he stood there now

He really ought to
have expected things to have
changed but still still was

The same tired man
as used to be laying there
entombed in his bed

Sunday or public
holiday wrapped up tightly
in his overcoat

He was standing up
straight enough now dressed in a
smart blue uniform

He probably did
not even know himself what
he had in mind but

Gregor was amazed
at the enormous size of
the soles of his boots

And so he ran up
to his father stopped when his
father stopped scurried

Gregor remained all
this time on the floor largely
because he feared his

Whatever he did
Gregor had to admit that
he certainly would

Gregor froze in shock
there was no longer any
point in running as

Gregor wanted to
drag himself away as if
he could remove the

He had suffered it
there for more than a month and
his condition seemed

He had been reduced
to the condition of an
ancient invalid

He got into the
habit of closely watching
it for one or two

They no longer held
the lively conversations
of earlier times

French in the evenings
so that she might be able
to get a better

The uniform had
not been new to start with but
as a result of

Gregor would often
spend the whole evening looking
at all the stains on

But since he had been
in work he had become more
obstinate and would

What a life This is
what peace I get in my old
age And supported

I get in my old
age And supported by the
two women he would

Who in this tired
and overworked family
would have had time to

Gregor to the new
address He could see quite well
though that there were more

Close that door Grete and
then when he was in the dark
again they would sit

Grete and then when he
was in the dark again they
would sit in the next

Gregor hardly slept
at all either night or day
Sometimes he would think

She still cleared up the
room in the evening but now
she could not have been

Smears of dirt were left
on the walls here and there were
little balls of dust

At first Gregor went
into one of the worst of
these places when his

At the same time she
became touchy in a way
that was quite new for

Gregor ill and he
lay flat on the couch bitter
and immobile But

But his mother was
to be punished still more for
what she had done as

Her father of course
was startled out of his chair
and the two parents

Instead of being
afraid the charwoman just
lifted up one of

Arent you coming
any closer then she asked
when Gregor turned round

At first he thought it
was distress at the state of
his room that stopped him

They had got into
the habit of putting things
into this room that

Gregor learned peering
through the crack in the door one
day were painfully

This meant not only
in their own room but since they
had taken a room

He fortunately
would usually see no
more than the object

At first he moved it
because with no other room
free where he could crawl

The gentlemen who
rented the room would sometimes
take their evening meal

But Gregor found it
easy to give up having
the door open he

The food was steaming
and filled the room with its smell
The gentlemen bent

The gentlemen bent
over the dishes set in
front of them as if

The gentlemen stood
as one and mumbled something
into their beards Then

The three gentlemen
had already finished their
meal the one in the

When the violin
began playing they became
attentive stood up

On the contrary
said the middle gentleman
would the young lady

His sister began
to play father and mother
paid close attention

Gregor had dared to
come forward a little and
already had his

Whats more there was now
all the more reason to keep
himself hidden as

The family was
totally preoccupied
with the violin

It really now seemed
very obvious that they
had expected to

It was especially
unnerving the way they all
blew the smoke from their

Her face was leant
to one side following the
lines of music with

He was determined
to make his way forward to
his sister and tug

On hearing all this
his sister would break out in
tears of emotion

Gregor would climb up
to her shoulder and kiss her
neck which since she had

The violin went
silent the middle of the
three gentlemen first

Now they did become
a little annoyed and it
was not clear whether

For the days that I
have been living here I will
of course pay nothing

I will consider
whether to proceed with some
kind of action for

And we also give
immediate notice With
that he took hold of

His disappointment
at the failure of his plan
and perhaps also

He was not even
startled out of this state when
the violin on

His mother who still
had not had time to catch her
breath began to cough

Gregor as he lay
there immobile We have to
try and get rid of

I cant endure it
any more And she broke out
so heavily in

And she broke out so
heavily in tears that they
flowed down the face of

His sister just shrugged
her shoulders as a sign of
the helplessness and

Gregor If it were
Gregor he would have seen long
ago that its not

She rushed over to
behind her father who had
become excited

Gregor had had no
intention of frightening
anyone least of

Now they all looked at
him in unhappy silence
His mother lay in

His mother lay in
her chair with her legs stretched out
and pressed against each

Noone was making him
rush any more everything
was left up to him

As soon as he had
finally finished turning
round he began to

He did not turn his
head until he had reached the
doorway He did not

He did not turn it
all the way round as he felt
his neck becoming

With his last glance he
saw that his mother had now
fallen completely

It was his sister
who had been in so much of
a rush She had been

She had been standing
there waiting and sprung forward
lightly Gregor had

Gregor had not heard
her coming at all and as
she turned the key in

What now then Gregor
asked himself as he looked round
in the darkness He

This was no surprise
to him it seemed rather that
being able to

He thought back of his
family with emotion
and love If it was

Gregor and at first
found nothing special She thought
he was laying there

She happened to be
holding the long broom in her
hand so she tried to

Gregor with it from
the doorway When she had no
success with that she

He crossed himself and
the three women followed his
example Grete who

The cleaner shut the
door and opened the window
wide Although it was

Although it was still
early in the morning the
fresh air had something

It was already
the end of March after all
The three gentlemen

March after all The
three gentlemen stepped out of
their room and looked round

The three gentlemen
stepped out of their room and looked
round in amazement

It was now quite light
in the room Then the door of
the bedroom opened

All of them had been
crying a little Grete now
and then pressed her face

Grete now and then pressed
her face against her fathers
arm Leave my home Now

The other two held
their hands behind their backs and
continually

At first he stood there
still looking at the ground as
if the contents of

Once there all three took
their hats from the stand took their
sticks from the holder

The cleaner came in
while they were writing to tell
them she was going

The charwoman stood
in the doorway with a smile
on her face as if

Grete bent down over
their letters as if intent
on continuing

They got up and went
over to the window where
they remained with their

Then he called out Come
here then Lets forget about
all that old stuff shall

Lets forget about
all that old stuff shall we Come
and give me a bit

Gregor one that was
in a better location
and most of all more

All the time Grete was
becoming livelier With
all the worry they

With all the worry
they had been having of late
her cheeks had become

Grete was the first to
get up and stretch out her young
body End of the
